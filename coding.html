        Here are some coding projects I have done. Most of them are in python, but I have made small
        scale school projects in other languages such as Java and C. I built this website from scratch
        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Larning new languages is fun for me. Getting familiar with how
        they work and what makes them different or similar to other ones I've used is an enjoyable
        process.

        During my internship of summer 2024, I got a variety of programming experience. Most of my tasks
        revolved around using SQL to collect data from the server and creating automation scripts for
        others to use. I utilized PowerShell to create most of the scripts, and I would sometimes implement them into a website
        for easy access. This website used .NET 6 Razor Pages as its building blocks, which gave me
        experience with real world applications of C#, HTML, and CSS.

            For my senior project, I worked with a group of four to create a portable solar power
            station. One aspect of the project I worked on was the external display. Shown below, it
            allows users to view statistics about the battery like the state of charge, battery voltage,
            overall wattage, etc. We used an ESP32 microcontroller to run the code for the SPI display.

            This is a python script that allows you to input an image and it creates a bouncing idle
            screen from it, like the classic DVD logo.
