        The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) club at Binghamton is a student-run organization dedicated to
        designing and building high-performance vehicles. As a member of the Formula team, I have gained a lot of
        hands-on experience in engineering design and teamwork.

            When I'm not coding or building robots, I enjoy exploring the world with my family. In the
            summer of 2023, we went out west to visit national parks and to see amazing natural
            creations, like the Grand Canyon.

            I love learning about anything technology related. News about recent tech
            developments, how different computer parts work, or even learning different programs to try
            them out. I had a lot of fun using the 3D modeling software Blender at one point, and this
            is a rendering of a scene I created from scratch following a tutorial.
