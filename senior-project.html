        My senior project focused on developing an interactive display system that combines hardware and software engineering principles. This project allowed me to apply everything I've learned throughout my academic career, from embedded systems programming to user interface design.

        The project involved creating a custom display interface with real-time data visualization and user interaction capabilities. It showcases my skills in both front-end development and embedded systems integration.

            The display system features a clean, intuitive interface designed for optimal user experience. 
            The hardware integration ensures reliable performance and responsive interactions.
