  <h1>Portable Solar Power Station</h1>
  <div class="project-section">
    <p>
      As part of my senior design project, I collaborated with a team to develop
      a Portable Solar Power Station. This system was designed to provide
      reliable, off-grid power for various applications, such as camping and
      emergency backup, featuring both solar and wall charging inputs and
      multiple power outputs.

  <h2>External Display</h2>

    <p>
      A key component of the system was the custom external display. Built
      around a 3.2-inch TFT LCD Touchscreen and an ESP32 microcontroller, this
      display provides users with real-time statistics directly from the Battery
      Management System (BMS). Key metrics include the State of Charge (%),
      total battery voltage (V), overall system current (A), battery temperature
      (°F), and wattage (W).
      <br /><br />
      During development, we prioritized rapid data updates over full
      touchscreen functionality, as critical information was accessible on the
      main screen. Integrating the BMS's UART communication directly into our
      code significantly improved performance and update speeds.

  <h2>Battery System</h2>
  <div class="project-section">
    <p>
      The core of our power station is a 12.8V nominal battery pack composed of
      four 3.2V, 230Ah LiFePO4 prismatic cells. We chose LiFePO4 chemistry for
      its high power density and inherent safety and stability, especially
      crucial for a portable device exposed to varying environments. Prismatic
      cells offered easier setup and greater customizability compared to
      cylindrical alternatives. A significant advantage of using individual
      cells was the ability to integrate an external Battery Management System
      (BMS), which provides detailed, real-time data inaccessible with
      all-in-one battery solutions.
      <br /><br />
      During assembly, we encountered a critical issue where the thin blue
      rubber coating on the cells could rub off, exposing live bare metal. This
      highlighted the absolute necessity of properly protecting the cells with
      electrically insulated materials to prevent short circuits.

    <h2>Project Exposition</h2>

    <p>
      The project culminated in a presentation at our department's senior design
      exposition, where we demonstrated the completed power station to faculty,
      industry advisors, and representatives from partner companies. This
      experience taught me how to effectively communicate complex technical
      concepts to diverse audiences and receive valuable feedback from
      practicing engineers.

    <h3>Future Improvements & Key Learnings</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the project, we identified several areas for future
      enhancements, such as implementing a global system switch, potentially
      controlled by the ESP32 to manage power draw, and refining the touchscreen
      functionality for smoother updates.
      <br /><br />
      This senior project was an invaluable experience that taught me the
      complexities of integrating diverse electrical and software components. I
      learned critical lessons in problem-solving, like diagnosing and resolving
      the inverter's grounding issue, and the importance of thorough component
      research and safety considerations, especially concerning exposed live
      metal on battery cells.
