        As part of my senior design project, I collaborated with a team to develop a Portable Solar Power Station. This
        system was designed to provide reliable, off-grid power for various applications, such as camping and emergency
        backup, featuring both solar and wall charging inputs and multiple power outputs.
        <br><br>
        My primary contributions focused on [Your specific roles, e.g., developing the external display system,
        integrating the BMS with the microcontroller, circuit design, and testing]. This project significantly enhanced
        my skills in [mention relevant skills like embedded systems, power electronics, CAD, project management,
        teamwork].

            A key component of the system was the custom external display, which I was primarily responsible for
            developing. Built around a 3.2-inch TFT LCD Touchscreen and an ESP32 microcontroller, this display provides
            users with real-time statistics directly from the Battery Management System (BMS). Key metrics include the
            State of Charge (%), total battery voltage (V), overall system current (A), battery temperature (Â°F), and
            wattage (W).
            <br><br>
            During development, we prioritized rapid data updates over full touchscreen functionality, as critical
            information was accessible on the main screen. Integrating the BMS's UART communication directly into our
            code significantly improved performance and update speeds.

    <h3>Battery System</h3>
    <p>
        The core of our power station is a 12.8V nominal battery pack composed of four 3.2V, 230Ah LiFePO4
        prismatic cells. We chose LiFePO4 chemistry for its high power density and inherent safety and
        stability, especially crucial for a portable device exposed to varying environments. Prismatic cells
        offered easier setup and greater customizability compared to cylindrical alternatives. A significant
        advantage of using individual cells was the ability to integrate an external Battery Management System
        (BMS), which provides detailed, real-time data inaccessible with all-in-one battery solutions.
        <br><br>
        During assembly, we encountered a critical issue where the thin blue rubber coating on the cells could
        rub off, exposing live bare metal. This highlighted the absolute necessity of properly protecting the
        cells with electrically insulated materials to prevent short circuits.

    <h3>Future Improvements & Key Learnings</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout the project, we identified several areas for future enhancements, such as implementing a global
        system switch, potentially controlled by the ESP32 to manage power draw, and refining the touchscreen
        functionality for smoother updates.
        <br><br>
        This senior project was an invaluable experience that taught me the complexities of integrating diverse
        electrical and software components. I learned critical lessons in problem-solving, like diagnosing and
        resolving the inverter's grounding issue, and the importance of thorough component research and safety
        considerations, especially concerning exposed live metal on battery cells.
